# JARVIS-SYSTEM

Do you remember J.A.R.V.I.S., Tony Stark's virtual personal assistant? If you've seen any of the Iron-man or Avengers movies, I'm sure you do. In this project my plan is to build a JARVIS System, that can Listen, take command, Speak.



**Project Description**

- **Project Name**: JARVIS-SYSTEM  
- **Objective**: This project aims to build a virtual personal assistant inspired by J.A.R.V.I.S. from the Iron Man and Avengers movies. The system is designed to listen to user commands, process them, and respond by speaking.  

## **Key Features**  
- **Listen**: The system can listen to user commands using speech recognition.  
- **Command Processing**: It processes the commands and performs the required actions.  
- **Speak**: The system responds to the user by speaking using text-to-speech functionality.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Python**: Core programming language for building the system.  
- **pyttsx3**: A text-to-speech conversion library for Python.  
- **Speech Recognition**: For capturing and interpreting user commands.  

## **Setup Instructions**  

- To create environment = `conda create -p <env_name> python=3.8 -y`
- To check available envs = `conda env list`
- To check available envs = `conda info --envs`
- To activate environment = `conda activate <env_name>`
- To install requirements.txt = `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- To check install packages = `pip list`
- To check detailed about package = `pip show package_name`
- To install package = `pip install package_name`
- To uninstall package = `pip uninstall package_name`
- To save all packages of env to a requirements.txt file = `pip freeze > requirements.txt`


## Git commands

- To add all file = `git add .`
- To add any particular file = `git add <file_name>`
- To commit = `git commit -m "commit message"`
- To push the code = `git push origin main`
